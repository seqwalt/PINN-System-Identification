# PINN System Identification
System identification of a dynamical system using a *physics-informed neural network* (PINN)

## Project Abstract
In this project, we consider the problem of learning unknown dynamics models of a lunar
lander using neural network techniques and partial information of the system dynamics. The
motivation is to combine the universal approximation property of neural networks and the
physical laws that are applied on the desired system in order to accurately identify the
dynamical model from limited or small amount of data. We use randomly generated data from
a simple lunar lander simulator and develop different learning algorithms to approximated
the dynamics model of the simulator.
